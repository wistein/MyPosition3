 My Position (Mein Standort), version 1.3.0
 
 Share your location, easily.
 
 My Position determines the current location with address data and GPS coordinates. The application also simplifies the task of sharing your location data with your contacts.
 
 Additionally, this application also includes a tool to help converting between WGS84 decimal GPS coordinate and DD MM SS coordinate format.

 It uses Reverse Geocoding by OpenStreetMap (OSM) query for showing address info, therefore uses optionally your provided email address as recommended by OSM.
 
 It shows a country-specific representation of address info (at, ch, de, fr, it, rest of the world), introduces localized strings (German, English) and considers localized number formats in calculations.
