<h4>Description</h4>
<b>My Position</b> determines the current location with address data and GPS coordinates including height above sea-level.<br>
The application simplifies the task of sharing your position data with your contacts.<br>
Your location may be shown on a map either local (if a suitable app is installed) or by browser on OpenStreetMap.<br>
Per Reverse Geocoding by OpenStreetMap query it shows local address info in most cases in a country-specific representation. To achieve this by a more reliable service and for protection against abuse it optionally takes your provided email address (see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim#Reverse_Geocoding).<br>
It introduces localized strings and considers localized number formats for German and English.<br>
There are two GPS coordinate formats supported: <br>
WGS84 Decimal coordinates and <br>
DD MM SS coordinates. <br>
Additionally, this application also includes a tool to help converting between WGS84 decimal GPS coordinate and DD MM SS coordinate format.<br>
<br>
