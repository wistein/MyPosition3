# MyPosition3
 
## My Position (Mein Standort)
 
Share your location, easily.  
The app simplifies the task of sharing your location data with your contacts.
### Features
- My Position determines the current location with address data and GPS coordinates including height above sea-level. 
- Your location may be shown on a map either local (if a suitable app is installed and the default setting of Google Maps is changed*) or by browser on OpenStreetMap.
- It uses Reverse Geocoding by OpenStreetMap (OSM) query for showing address info.**)
- It shows a country-specific representation of address info (at, ch, de, fr, it, rest of the world), introduces localized strings and number formats (German, English).
- Additionally, the app also includes a tool to help converting between WGS84 decimal GPS coordinate and DD MM SS coordinate format.
- Runs on Android 5.0 or newer.

*) To change the default from Google Maps to a preferred app,
- open <i>Settings</i> on your phone, 
- select <I>Apps</I>, 
- find <i>Maps</i> and select <i>Clear defaults</i>. 
- Head back to <i>My Position</I> and call <I>Show Map</I>. 
- Now youâ€™ll be asked which application to use.  
Pick the one you prefer,
- select <i>This time</I> to test it.  
Next time you may select <i>Always</I> to make sure your preferred app opens by default.

**) To achieve OSM Reverse Geocoding by a more reliable service and for protection against abuse it optionally takes your provided email address  
(see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim#Reverse_Geocoding).
