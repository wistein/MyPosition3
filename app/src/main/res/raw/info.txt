 <h3>My Position</h3>
 <h4>Version 1.3.1</h4>
 Share your location, easily.<br>
 <br>
 <h4>Description</h4>
 <b>My Position</b> determines the current location with address data and GPS coordinates including height above sea-level.<br>
 The application also simplifies the task of sharing your position data with your contacts.<br>
 Your location may also be shown on a map either local (if a suitable app is installed) or by browser on OpenStreetMap.<br>
 There are two GPS coordinate formats supported: <br>
 WGS84 Decimal coordinates and <br>
 DD MM SS coordinates. <br>
 Additionally, this application also includes a tool to help converting between
 WGS84 decimal GPS coordinate and DD MM SS coordinate format.<br>
